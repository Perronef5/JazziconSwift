# JazziconSwift

Jazzy Identicons written in pure swift, rewritten from [jazzicon-js](https://github.com/danfinlay/jazzicon) using swift.

`Say goodbye to boring blocky identicons that look like they came out of the 70s, and replace them with jazzy, colorful collages that more likely came out of the 80's.`
